[English](CONTRIBUTING.md) | [Português (Brasil)](CONTRIBUTING.pt-BR.md)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Antigravity Account Switcher**!

We welcome bug reports, improvements, documentation updates, and feature requests. Please follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth contribution process.

## Development Prerequisites

- **Go:** Version 1.24+ ([Download Go](https://go.dev/dl/))
- **Git:** Standard git client
- **Make:** GNU Make (optional, but recommended)
- **GCC / C Toolchain:** Required only when running tests with the Go race detector (`-race`). The release binary compiles with `CGO_ENABLED=0` (pure-Go SQLite via `modernc.org/sqlite`).
- **golangci-lint:** Version 1.60+ ([Installation Guide](https://golangci-lint.run/welcome/install/))

---

## Getting Started

1. **Fork and Clone:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samucamg/antigravity-account-switcher.git
   cd antigravity-account-switcher
   ```

2. **Verify Environment:**
   Run the test suite to ensure your environment is configured properly:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

3. **Build the Static Binary:**
   ```bash
   make build
   ./bin/antigravity-account-switcher version
   ```

## Running Tests & Linters

Every Pull Request is validated automatically by GitHub Actions. Before submitting code, run the following locally:

```bash
# 1. Run unit and integration tests with the data race detector
make test-race

# 2. Run static analysis and linting
make lint

# 3. Format Go code according to standard style
make fmt
```

All tests must pass with `0` data races, and `golangci-lint` must complete with zero warnings.
