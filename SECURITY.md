## OAuth 2.0 & Native Application Client Credentials

### RFC 8252 §8.5 Compliance (Public Clients)

Antigravity Account Switcher communicates with Google APIs to manage account authentication and quota tracking. Under the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specification **[RFC 8252 (OAuth 2.0 for Native Apps)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8252#section-8.5)**:

> *"A native app client is considered a public client... unable to maintain the confidentiality of its credentials. Authorization servers MUST NOT treat native app client secrets as confidential."*

The Google OAuth client credentials dynamically discovered or used by this application identify the client application as **Google Cloud Code / Antigravity Desktop**. They do not grant administrative rights or access to private resources without explicit user consent via Google's consent screen.

### Custom Credentials & Enterprise Overrides

If you or your organization prefer to use your own Google Cloud Console OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials, you can override them via environment variables:

```bash
export ANTIGRAVITY_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com"
export ANTIGRAVITY_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"
```

### Local Storage and Privacy

- **Zero Telemetry Leakage:** All access tokens, refresh tokens, and token metrics are stored strictly on your local filesystem in an encrypted or restricted-permission SQLite database (`~/.config/antigravity-account-switcher/accounts.db`).
- **No Cloud Telemetry:** This application does not send telemetry, tokens, or personal identifiers to any third-party servers. All proxy traffic flows exclusively between your local Antigravity 2.0 application and official Google Cloud endpoints (`daily-cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com` and `accounts.google.com`).
